As the stress items are hand cut, not all edges and mould lines will be consistently smooth, that is a given and is acceptable. White stress shapes will eventually turn yellow, sunlight and heat will accelerate this process. The special PU ink is transparent and impossible to guarantee a consistent, uniform imprint. A broad imprint area is subject to breaking up, the imprint may not be of a solid colour. The print is not permanent, as it will wear off after some usage. The PU sponge stress shapes will tear if enough force is applied. Stress shapes are not a toy. Not suitable for children or animals. The traditional white PU material will turn to yellow easily in few months time, we use a new white PU material for our white stress balls which will keep the white colour a lot longer, but the new white PU material will show very very slight purple-ish colour, please contact us for a sample before you place orders.","isOnSale":false,"isFreightFree":true,"isOverseasSourcing":false,"images":[""],"productDisclaimer":"GST additional.
