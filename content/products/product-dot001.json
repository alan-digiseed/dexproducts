The Dot is an elegantly compact pen but its originality is revealed in its details. The tiny ball set in the push-button creates a tasteful touch of colour that turns a component that is famously “unattractive” into a premium detail. The clip is of highly refined appearance: unlike all the others it was conceived with a wide range of horizontal curves and an original side edge. The clip’s sleek lines frame the extensive customisation space: here brand strength is enhanced and takes on a new propulsive drive. There are numerous versions available but if the variants on offer do not include the one you are looking for, the Dot lends itself perfectly to “made-to-measure” solutions, and special colour combinations can be experimented for the push-button, decorative ball, clip and barrel. Retractable with return spring, colourful barrel with white clip and push button, made of non-toxic, highly resistant ABS plastic, galvanic process used to chrome the ABS push-button. Jumbo refill available in black or blue ink. Up to 2500 metres of writing.","additionalInfo":"Italian Design and Make.
